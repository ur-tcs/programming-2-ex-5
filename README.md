# Programming 2 - Exercise 5 : Higher Order functions and Boids

In this exercise, you'll start by revisiting exercise 2's questions, and search for ways to leverage the power of higher-order functions to write shorter, simpler code. Then you'll become familiar with the notion of “functions as values”. You’ll store functions in `val`s, combine them, make functions that make functions that make functions, etc. 

In the second part of this exercises, you will be writing a simulation of a flock of boids 🐦. 

As before, exercises or questions marked ⭐️ are the most important, and 🔥 are the most challenging. Questions marked ☁️ are not directly relevant to the class; they just provide additional directions to think about if you are interested. Questions marked 🔜 are useful to prepare for future lectures.

This exercise is made of two distinct folder, [higher_order](higher_order) and [boids](boids). We recommend you to open them one at a time to avoid VSCode build's issues. Instruction for each exercise can be found in the `README.md` of corresponding folder.
